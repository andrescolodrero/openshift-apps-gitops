# Getting Started with OpenShift GitOps

OpenShift GitOps is an add-on on OpenShift which provides Argo CD and other tooling to enable teams to implement GitOps workflows for cluster configuration and application delivery. OpenShift GitOps provides [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as the core of the GitOps workflow and [GitOps Application Manager CLI](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam) in order to help developers bootstrap a GitOps workflow for delivering applications.

This repository contains a brief Getting Started guide for trying out OpenShift GitOps.
